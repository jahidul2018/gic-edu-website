                East Asian country China, officially People’s Republic of China (PRC), is located in eastern Asia. It is the largest of all Asian countries and world’s most populous country. China emerged as one of the world’s earliest civilizations and has a great physical diversity as well. It has the fastest growing economy and real estate in the world. China makes more millionaires each year than any other country combined. This makes China the go-to spot for any international Entrepreneur looking to start a business. China’s success is based on a mixed economy that incorporated limited capitalism within a command economy.

 

Immigration to China is exceptionally diverse. With a robust economy, welcoming universities, and low living costs, the country attracts people from all parts of the world. Relatively lenient visa policies have allowed entry to migrants from a range of backgrounds.
